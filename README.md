Next-Gen Media Manager Design Notes
Core Problem: Users have overflowing iCloud accounts and find it difficult to search through their large collections of photos and videos.
Core Solution: A media manager that uses AI and an intuitive interface to make searching, browsing, and rediscovering memories effortless.
Key Features:
Intelligent Search:
AI-Powered Tagging & Categorization: Automatic identification of objects, people (facial recognition), locations (GPS), and scenes/events.
Advanced Filtering: Search by date range, file type, camera model, keywords, recognized objects, people, locations, and combinations thereof.
Search Within Images (OCR): Ability to search for text present within photos.
Voice Input & Natural Language Search: Users can use voice commands and natural language queries (e.g., "Show me beach photos from last summer").
Intuitive Browsing:
User Choice: Option to browse via:
Intelligent Timeline (Default): Chronological view enhanced with location and event awareness, visually grouping media and allowing easy navigation.
AI-Powered Smart Collections: Automatically generated albums based on AI-detected themes (e.g., "Vacations," "Family," "Nature").
Dynamic Layouts: Potential for the app to dynamically adjust the presentation of media.
Swipeable Carousel for Search Results: Displaying search results in an easy-to-navigate carousel.
Seamless Integration:
iCloud & Local Storage Support: Ability to manage photos and videos stored in iCloud, locally on the device, or a combination. Configuration options for users.
Automatic Background Processing: New photos and videos are automatically analyzed and tagged when detected.
Permission-Based Access: Requires explicit user permission to access iCloud Photos.
Easy Setup:
Clear onboarding process for granting permissions and setting storage preferences.
Transparent background processing with potential progress indication for initial library analysis. Option to prioritize analysis by year.
Platform Choice: iOS First using SwiftUI for the user interface and Apple's native Vision and Create ML frameworks for AI/ML capabilities.
Initial Onboarding:
User grants permission to their iCloud account (if desired).
User chooses storage preferences (iCloud, local, or both).
Initial tagging and analysis begin as a background task, potentially with an option to prioritize by year.
User Interface (Conceptual):
Primary Screen: Offers a choice between the Intelligent Timeline and Smart Collections. Prominent search bar with voice input.
Intelligent Timeline: Chronological with visual grouping by location and event. Swipeable to navigate.
Smart Collections: Visually appealing display of AI-generated albums.
Search Results: Presented in a swipeable carousel with key information (location, date, time) highlighted.
Next Steps (for you):
Start learning SwiftUI and the Vision framework.
Begin prototyping the user interface concepts.
Experiment with the AI capabilities of the Vision framework for image analysis.
